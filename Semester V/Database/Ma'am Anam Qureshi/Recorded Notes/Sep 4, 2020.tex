    \section{Server}

    It is a computer program that handles multiple requests, or multiple users.

    If your DMBS is residing on a server, than multiple users can use that server to access the data.

    In database servers, the DBMS resides on the server. The server has its own operating system.   

    A DMBS is always deployed on a server.

    Usually we have multiple copies of the server, in case anyone of these goes down. 

    \section{Database Management System}

    It provides recovery and backup.

    These are less redundant.

    Redundancy would mean that there is replication or duplication of data across the records.

    \section{File Based System}

    It rather stores it in files and is inconsistent.

    It does not give you the options to do recovery and backups.

    It uses hard disk, more redundacy, no multiple views, does not support concurrency.
